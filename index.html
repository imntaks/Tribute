      <p class = "first-para">Charles Darwin famous for his work,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species" target="_blank">&#8216;On the Origin of Species by means of natural selection&#8217;</a>,  more popularly known as &#8216;The Origin of Species&#8217;, was a naturalist who lived in England during the Victorian era. His ideas about the world we live in were considered radical at the time. He was a free thinker, with a passion for Natural History from a young age. It was his voyage on the HMS Beagle around the world, an opportunity of a lifetime, that his investigations and observations lead him to the theory of evolution.</p>
                

        <p>Charles Darwin made a name for himself  by publishing an account of his travels and it was only later that he presented his findings  on evolution and published &#8216;The Origin of Species&#8217;, mainly because of the society he lived in, a society not open to ideas, a society which ostracized his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, for writing about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmutation_of_species" target="_blank">transmutation</a>. Evidence on his theory of evolution were revealed through DNA studies years after his death.</p>
          
            
        <p>He continued to challenge ideas that were considered the norm then with his works such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Descent_of_Man,_and_Selection_in_Relation_to_Sex" target="_blank">&#8216;The Descent of Man&#8217;</a> and went on to publish his works, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expression_of_the_Emotions_in_Man_and_Animals" target="_blank">&#8216;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&#8217;</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Movement_in_Plants" target="_blank">&#8216;The Power of Movement in Plants&#8217;</a>. His final work was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Formation_of_Vegetable_Mould_through_the_Action_of_Worms" target="_blank">&#8216;The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms&#8217;</a>.</p>
          
      <p>Charles Darwin’s works on evolution was revolutionary and gave meaning to our world and the existence of all its inhabitants. Apart from his scientific achievements and contributions, he was also a political liberal who was against slavery. He challenged himself and the society and lead the way to how we see the world we live in today.<!--He was able to bring a change to the perspective, that people had of the world, at a time when it was considered a taboo.--> </p></br>
